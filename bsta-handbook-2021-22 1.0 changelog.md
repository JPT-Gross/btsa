- Procedure 7. "come to rest on" changed to "touch" to avoid students purposely
colliding with obstructions to slow their aircraft's descent.  
- Regulations 1. "tissue" changed to "parchment" as this is what the popular 
Pitsco Right Flyer ships with.
## Hydro Rocket
- Evaluation "gets stuck" replaced with "touches an obstruction, or leaves the
sight of the judge" for clarification.
## Graphic Design
- No noteable revisions.
## CNC Challange
- **This challange got completely overhauled**, please re-read this section 
carefully. This challange is no longer a board game design challange. It is now
a speed design challange where the participants will create a "mating" part to a
part that will be revealed to the participants the day of the competition.
## Trebuchet
- Procedure 3. "from behind the designated foul-line." added
- Procedure 4. "Participants choose the location of the target." added
- Procedure 4. "Students may move back from the target, increasing the distance 
to the target for distance awards." Removed because this is not needed. Distance 
can be measured seperately from accuracy.
- Evaluation. "Scoring Formula: a * (d - 6) where "a" is the accuracy score 
according to Procedure point 4. and "d" is distance measured in feet. Example: 
a bullseye hit at 10 feet would be 5*(10-6) = **20** points." added for 
clarification.
## Robotics
- **This challange got completely overhauled**, please re-read this section 
carefully. This challange is no longer a search and rescue challange is now a 
VEX Robotics competition.
## Bridge Design
- Procedure 5. Removed. Test plate will not be glued to bridge.
